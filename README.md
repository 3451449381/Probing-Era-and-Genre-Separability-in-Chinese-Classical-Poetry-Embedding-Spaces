# Probing-Era-and-Genre-Separability-in-Chinese-Classical-Poetry-Embedding-Spaces
This project investigates whether semantic embeddings of Chinese classical poetry encode discernible signals of historical era (e.g., Tang vs. Song dynasty) and literary genre (e.g., jueju, lüshi, and ci). Without training large language models or performing text generation, we adopt off-the-shelf Chinese sentence embedding models (such as text2vec-base-chinese) to represent each poem as a fixed-dimensional vector. We then train simple classifiers—primarily logistic regression—to probe for era and genre information in these embeddings. Quantitative evaluation (accuracy, F1, confusion matrices) and qualitative visualization (via t-SNE or UMAP) are used to assess the degree of separability. Our goal is to determine whether stylistic and temporal characteristics of classical Chinese poetry are implicitly captured in modern embedding spaces, offering insights into the representational capacity of pre-trained models for cultural and historical text analysis.
